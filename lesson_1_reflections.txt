How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It was odd figuring out how to use diff, but it was a lot easier to find the change.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can see past mistakes or how the document was created. This may help you understand where to go in the future.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
You have to commit to doing and think about how you make changes. It is good as I often leave off of documenting and then can't figure out what happened.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
For coding, documents will probably be linked, but for text files, they will not be linked.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
You can use log to see a summary of changes, and diff to see specifics.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can always go back and see what happened.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to share programs so I can work on Kaggle competitions.
