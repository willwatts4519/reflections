When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you work on a different computer or have someone else work on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You can state why you made the change and you can specify where it is going. It keeps remote conflicts seperate.
