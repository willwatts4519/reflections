When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you work on a different computer or have someone else work on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You can state why you made the change and you can specify where it is going. It keeps remote conflicts seperate.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are changes made in GitHub, clones are changes made from GitHub to your local computer, and branches are changes made within Git. Use Fork to copy someones code and give credit, clone to work on local, and branch to make changes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can work off-line and make changes and test things off that change.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without, I would create documents and change names, then e-mail and give or get comments back. It would be easier to track documents, and provide a similar amount of control, but my old way would be simpler for folks who do not have git.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When I want to experiement with a change or keep 2 versions.
